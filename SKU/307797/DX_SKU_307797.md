# DX.com SKU 307797 ("LSON A1M1 Ultrasonic Wave Radar Ranging Boosting Transformer")

I purchased this (5 pieces) in the hope of providing a voltage boost to a 40kHz ultrasound transducer I'm experimenting with for distance ranging.  
Unfortunately the dx.com site provides little in the way of technical specifications. It turns out this transformer is designed to operate at
about 300kHz. It's pretty useless at 40kHz. 

Measurements that I made:

* Primary coil resistance 3 ohms +/- 0.5 ohms
* Secondary coil resistance 17 ohms +/- 0.5 ohms
* Turn ratio seems to be 1:10

The primary coil is on the side with two pins. The secondary on the side with 3 pins. The center of the three pins is not connected.
