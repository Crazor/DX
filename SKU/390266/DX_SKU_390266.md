# Documenation for RST5110 Wireless Bluetooth laser barcode scanner  

This documents Deal Extreme DX.com SKU 390266 2.4GHz / Bluetooth barcode scanner. 

The supplied documentation provided no download link, so I'm adding online 
documentation and additional information about this barcode scanner here.

The 'magic' codes to program the device are actually Code128 barcodes. So if
you need to replicate those codes (eg for a in-house programming procedure manual)
you only need to get a smartphone scanner app, scan the code in the manual
and then use a Code128 barcode generator to re-create the code. That's a 
lot cleaner than photo scanning the original manual.

There are [many free barcode generators](https://www.google.ie/search?q=barcode+generator&oq=barcode+generator) 
on the internet. One thing to note: because it is a laser scanner you cannot 
scan off screen: you must print before scanning.

| Suffix TAB                        | 00202011000$09  | |

## Observations

The manual only lists a few suffix options, but the code may allow more: ie 00202011000$xx and 00202011000$xx$yy
where xx and yy are the ASCII codes of the character. Question: how about special keys (eg arrow key etc?)
