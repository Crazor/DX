# Documenation for USB 2.0 Wired Barcode Scanner for Standard 1D Bar Codes 

The documents DX.com SKU 454973 USB bar code scanner. 

The supplied documentation provided no download link, so I'm adding online 
documentation etc here.

The 'magic' codes to program the device are actually Code_128 codes. So if
you need to replicate those codes (eg for developing a procedure manual)
you only need to get a smartphone scanner app, scan the code in the manual
and then use a Code_128 barcode generator to re-create the code (that's a 
lot cleaner than scanning the original manual).
