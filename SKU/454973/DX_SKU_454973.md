# Documenation for USB 2.0 Wired Barcode Scanner for Standard 1D Bar Codes 

This documents DX.com SKU 454973 USB bar code scanner. 

The supplied documentation provided no download link, so I'm adding online 
documentation and additional information about this barcode scanner here.

The 'magic' codes to program the device are actually Code128 barcodes. So if
you need to replicate those codes (eg for a in-house programming procedure manual)
you only need to get a smartphone scanner app, scan the code in the manual
and then use a Code128 barcode generator to re-create the code. That's a 
lot cleaner than photo scanning the original manual.

There are [many free barcode generators](https://www.google.ie/search?q=barcode+generator&oq=barcode+generator) on the internet. One thing to note: because it is a laser scanner you cannot scan off screen: you must print before scanning.

~~Another thing of note: this means there are certain Code128 codes this barcode scanner cannot scan (for example "000A0"). Any of the codes documented in this page will invoke a special function on the scanner and it will not pass the code along to the host computer. As these codes are rather short I suspect this is a bug/difficiency that some users will encouter.~~ (see update below).

**Update 2017-10-24** ok, it's not just a simple as printing those using any Code128 generator. It seems Code128 is a little complex (there is more than one way to encode the same string) and these magic codes are exploiting this. So even though my ZXing Android app recognizes these codes as "Code 128 Text", when I generate the codes doesn't invoke the special function. Investigating... ok: details of [Code128 on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_128) it seems the magic codes start with at [START B] symbol followed by a [FNC3] followed by the codes below. So I withdraw my above criticism: these 
are unlikely codes to encounter under normal use. Now to figure out how to generate these codes: passing a simple string to a general purpose generator won't do. I need to specify a string of low level symbols. Maybe the ZXing library.

**Update 2017-10-25** Disappointly this scanner does not retain programming after a power cycle. Perhaps the memory on mine is fauly. I have another few on order so I'll know soon. This makes a customized programming sheet even more important.

**Update 2017-10-28** I sucessfully generated programming codes with Javascript barcode generation library JsBarcode. For example a factory reset can be generated like so:
```
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/jsbarcode@3.8.0/dist/barcodes/JsBarcode.code128.min.js"></script>
<svg id="barcode"></svg>
<script>
JsBarcode("#barcode","\xC9000B0",{format:"CODE128B"});
</script>
```

## Add code ID

This function allows a single character to be added at the beginning (prefix) or at the 
end (suffix) of the actual barcode to indicate the [barcode symbology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barcode#Symbologies) used (eg Code128 vs EAN13 etc)

| Function                          | Code   | Comment
| ----------------------------------|--------|----
| No code prefix/suffix             |  01400 | |
| Send code as prefix               |  01401 | |
| Send code as suffix               |  01402 | |

| Code prefix/suffix | Barcode symbology |
| -------------------| ------------------|
| a                  | Code128 |
| d                  | EAN13 |

## Alphabet

This is a long table of codes for characters and keys. It seems to be just "1xxx" where xxx is the ASCII code of the 
character in decimal for regular characters (including non-printable ASCII characters below 32). This table also includes
special keys (eg up arrow, Home, End etc). The mapping to those keys doesn't seem to follow any established standard, 
but are sill in format "1xxx". For example key F11 is "1138", down arrow is "1148". 

The exact  Code128 barcode symbols are  START B, FNC3, Code C, (numberic code in table), Stop.
(Code C encodes two decimal digits at a time.)


| Character             | Code  |
| ----------------------|-------|
| ASCII a, a = 1 .. 127 | 1000+a|
| F1                    | 1128  |
| Fn, n  = 1..12        | 1127+n|
| Down arrow            | 1148  |
